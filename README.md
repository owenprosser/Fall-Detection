# Fall-Detection

## Computer Vision Fall Detection System using Python and OpenCV.

Webcam feed is processed to detect falls of human subjects.

To use:-

*  Edit **line 11** in fallDetection.py to add your own video to process
* *(Film subject against clear-ish background and from a fair distance for best results)*

```
11: cap = cv2.VideoCapture('*yourVideoFileHere.extension*')
```
